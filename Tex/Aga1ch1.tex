\chapter{Introduction}

Conflicts around the world threaten individuals’ peace and security. International organizations, such as the United Nations, are tasked with maintaining peace and ensuring that a person’s right to security is not breached. As such, the UN carries out peacekeeping operations with the aim of restoring and creating lasting peace in areas of conflict. The failure of UN Peacekeeping Operations to restore peace in some areas questions the effectiveness of these operations and calls for a thorough review and reform to ensure that they are in line with the UN Charter’s principles. The recent deaths and injuries of peacekeepers in Mali brings into focus the increasing attacks on peacekeepers themselves and the severe threat to their safety. On the other hand, with reports rising of sexual assault and misconduct of peacekeepers, review is essential for determining whether the success of these operations is deterred by chosen troops and their behaviors. With all this in mind, SPECPOL will consider the safety and security of peacekeepers, expanding and strengthening support capacities for missions, the capacity for civilian protection and the conduct of peacekeepers in this debate for reform.
